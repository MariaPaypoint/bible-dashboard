  "product_overview": "Bible Audio Alignment Anomalies is a web-based tool designed to identify, review, and correct timing mismatches in audio-aligned Bible verses. It empowers operators to filter, listen, validate, and manually adjust audio alignment anomalies to ensure precise synchronization of scripture audio with text.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Enable efficient detection and filtering of audio alignment anomalies by voice, book, type, and status.",
    "Provide an intuitive interface for operators to listen to verses and review anomalies in context.",
    "Allow manual correction of verse timing with fine-grained controls and preview capabilities.",
    "Support workflow automation through auto-advance while ensuring accurate and reliable anomaly handling.",
    "Facilitate creation of manual anomaly reports when issues are not automatically detected."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Multi-criteria filters including Voice (mandatory), Book, Anomaly Type, and Status to refine anomaly lists.",
    "Detailed anomalies table showing code, scripture reference, problematic word, anomaly type, additional info, deviation ratio, status with quick editable dropdown, and play buttons for audio context.",
    "A floating mini audio player that highlights words during playback, supports verse navigation (next/previous), quick check playback mode, and auto-advance between anomalies.",
    "Manual verse timing correction tools with adjustable start/end time shifts at multiple step sizes (1s, 0.1s, 0.01s), preview playback of adjusted timings, and automated overlap detection with neighboring verses.",
    "Dialog for manual creation of anomaly tickets if automated detection misses an error."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Operator selects the Voice (translation) filter to load anomalies.",
    "The system displays a filtered list of anomalies matching the selected criteria.",
    "Operator plays audio snippets for each anomaly to verify timing issues.",
    "If the anomaly is confirmed, the operator updates its status to 'confirmed error'; if not, marks as 'alignment correct'.",
    "For timing errors, operator opens the timing correction dialog, adjusts start and end times with preview, and applies corrections.",
    "If enabled, auto-advance moves operator to the next anomaly seamlessly after actions.",
    "Operators may create new anomaly tickets manually as needed via a dedicated dialog."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Filters correctly restrict the anomaly list based on Voice, Book, Type, and Status selections.",
    "Anomalies table renders with all required columns and interactive elements like status dropdown and play buttons.",
    "Audio player functions correctly with word highlighting and supports navigation and quick check playback.",
    "Timing correction controls adjust timestamps precisely and prevent overlap conflicts, with previews reflecting changes.",
    "Status updates and anomaly corrections persist accurately in the backend.",
    "Manual anomaly creation dialog appears as expected and submissions create new anomaly records.",
    "Auto advance navigation reliably progresses through filtered anomalies after actions."
